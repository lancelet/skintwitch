== Introduction ==

This is the cutaneous trunci skin twitch project.

== Current Status ==

Completed:
  - Power spectral analysis of initial trials.
Working on:
  - Computing the skin deformation gradient tensor.
  
== Installation ==

Check out the project from GitHub (this command uses the Read-Only
repository):

  $ git clone git://github.com/lancelet/skintwitch.git

This will create a new directory called `skintwitch`.  Next, use
http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/[sbt] to compile the project:

  $ cd skintwitch
  $ sbt

http://code.google.com/p/simple-build-tool/[sbt] will launch, and collect
everything it needs for the project.  Within `sbt`, you can then run:

  > update
  > test

This will run the packaged unit tests for the project.
