== Installation ==

Check out the project from GitHub (this command uses the Read-Only
repository):

  $ git clone git://github.com/lancelet/skintwitch.git

This will create a new directory called `skintwitch`.  Next, use
https://github.com/harrah/xsbt[sbt/xsbt] to compile the project:

  $ cd skintwitch
  $ sbt

https://github.com/harrah/xsbt[sbt/xsbt] will launch, and collect
everything it needs for the project.  Within `sbt`, you can then run:

  > test

This will run the packaged unit tests for the project.
