  abstract = {Smoothing and differentiation of noisy signals are common problems
	whenever it is difficult or impossible to obtain derivatives by direct
	measurement. In biomechanics body displacements are frequently assessed
	and these measurements are affected by noise. To avoid high-frequency
	noise magnification, data filtering before differentiation is needed.
	In the approach reported here an autoregressive model is fitted to
	the signal. This allows the evaluation of the filter bandwidth and
	the extrapolation of the data. The extrapolation also reduces edge
	effects. Low-pass filtering is performed in the frequency domain
	by a linear phase FIR filter and differentiation is performed in
	the frequency domain. The reported results illustrate the accuracy
	of the algorithm and its speed (mainly due to the use of the FFT
	algorithm). Automatic bandwidth selection also guarantees the homogeneity
	of the results.},

	gradient tensor within a fracture callus.},

  abstract = {Tracking tissue deformation is often hampered by material inhomogeneity,
	so local measurements tend to be insufficient thus lending to the
	necessity of full-field optical measurements. This study presents
	a novel approach to factoring heterogeneous deformation of soft and
	hard tissues in a fracture callus by introducing an anisotropic metric
	derived from the deformation gradient tensor (F). The deformation
	gradient tensor contains all the information available in a Green-Lagrange
	strain tensor, plus the rigid-body rotational components. A recent
	study [Bottlang et al., Journal of Biomechanics 41(3), 2008] produced
	full-field strains within ovine fracture calluses acquired through
	the application of electronic speckle pattern interferometery (ESPI).
	The technique is based on infinitesimal strain approximation (Engineering
	Strain) whose scheme is not independent of rigid-body rotation. In
	this work, for rotation extraction, the stretch and rotation tensors
	were separately determined from F by the polar decomposition theorem.
	Interfragmentary motions in a fracture gap were characterized by
	the two distinct mechanical factors (stretch and rotation) at each
	material point through full-field mapping. In the composite nature
	of bone and soft tissue, collagen arrangements are hypothesized such
	that fibers locally aligned with principal directions will stretch
	and fibers not aligned with the principal direction will rotate and
	stretch. This approach has revealed the deformation gradient tensor
	as an appropriate quantification of strain within callus bony and
	fibrous tissue via optical measurements.},
